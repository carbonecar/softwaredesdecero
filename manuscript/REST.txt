Why REST? REST In Practice proffers, to borrow Martin Fowler’s phrasing,
"the notion that the web is an existence proof of a massively scalable distributed system that works
really well, and we can take ideas from that to build integrated systems more easily."
I think that’s a pretty good reason: REST embraces the precepts of the web itself,
and embraces its architecture, benefits and all.


What benefits? Principally all those that come for free with HTTP as a platform itself.
Application security (encryption and authentication) are known quantities today for which
there are known solutions. Caching is built into the protocol.
Service routing, through DNS, is a resilient and well-known system already ubiquitously support.
